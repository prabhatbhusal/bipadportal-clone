# BIPAD Portal Clone

## Overview

This project is a clone of the [BIPAD Portal](https://bipadportal.gov.np/), a disaster information and management system designed to provide real-time data, resources, and tools for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery in Nepal. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and utilizing [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) for interactive mapping, this clone aims to replicate the core functionalities and design of the original site for educational, testing, or development purposes.

## Features

- **Disaster Data Dashboard**: Real-time information on disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, landslides).
- **Interactive Maps**: Dynamic GIS-based maps powered by OpenLayers to visualize affected areas.
- **Resources Section**: Access to disaster-related reports, guidelines, and documents.
- **Multilingual Support**: Interface in English and Nepali (assumed based on context).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices using Next.js.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation)
- **Mapping**: [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) (open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps)
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (optional, adjust as per your setup)
- **Backend**: (Optional) Node.js with an API or external data source for disaster data
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (recommended for Next.js projects)
